# Working From a Theme in Hugo

This repository illustrates how you might choose a Hugo theme and modify its example site to build a site of your own.

## Installation

The repository uses the [personal-web](https://github.com/bjacquemet/personal-web) as a submodule, so you must clone recursively:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/homerhanumat/pweb.git
```

## Use

We will check out the branches in order to follow development of the project.
