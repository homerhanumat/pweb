I'm not going to make a big effort, here; after all, this is just to help you illustrate how your Hugo project might go.

You'll want to do it up, though:  say some _true_ things about yourself:

* one true thing
* and another
* and yet another
* perhaps in an unordered list, like this one
  * with sub-lists, even
  * like this one!

Maybe use some blockquotes:

> I like static-site generators.

You could throw in a table or two:

| Person | Favorite Programming Language |
| --- | --- |
| Homer | R |
| Luke | Python |
| Kaitlyn | R |
| Matthew | C++ |

**Note**:  I am not happy with:

1. how lists render
2. the styling of blockquotes
3. the styling of tables

Here is a **sentence** to test forestry.io
