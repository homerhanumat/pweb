## Introduction

I'm not going to make a big effort, here; after all, this is just to help you illustrate how your Hugo project might go.

## Random Markdown Stuff

You'll want to do it up, though:  say some _true_ things about yourself:

* one true thing
* and another
* and yet another
* perhaps in an unordered list, like this one
  * with sub-lists, even
  * like this one!

Nesting with ordered lists:

* get up
* get coffee
  1. strong
  2. dark

Maybe use some blockquotes:

> I like static-site generators.

You could throw in a table or two:

| Person | Favorite Programming Language |
| :--- | :--- |
| Homer | R |
| Luke | Python |
| Kaitlyn | R |
| Matthew | C++ |

## Fixes

I threw in some custom css

1. to fix upper margin on unordered lists
2. to make tables a bit nicer

I should do something about the blockquotes.

## Tweets?

I wonder how the Tweet shortcode works:

{{< tweet-single 1032398933513912320 >}}

Looks like the theme's `tweet-single` is a wrapper for an internal hugo Twitter shortcode.
